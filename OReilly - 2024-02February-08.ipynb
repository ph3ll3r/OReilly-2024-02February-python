    "A general-purpose computer can be given instructions as to what it should do. Those instructions come in the form of binary numbers (1s and 0s). You can, in theory, write those 1s and 0s yourself -- but it's not fun or easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we write programs in a \"high-level language,\" one that is closer to how humans think and write, and then our program is translated into binary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programming language works in a slightly different way. Some are closer to the binary code, and some are closer to how humans think and write.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C is a \"low-level language,\" because it's closer to the hardware\n",
    "- Java and C# are mid-level languages, because they're higher level than C, taking care of such things as managing the memory in your program, but they still require you to think a lot like a computer\n",
    "- Python is a \"very high level language,\" where it tries to look and feel like a natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages need to be unambiguous and clear. Python, though, is designed to be as easy as possible for people to learn, while still providing us with the same power as other languages.  \"Low floors and high ceilings\"\n",
