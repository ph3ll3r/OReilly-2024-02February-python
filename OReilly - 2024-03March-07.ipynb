    "1. If we have several lines in a row that are roughly the same, we can combine them into a loop.\n",
    "2. If we have the same code repeated across several parts of our program, we can write that code once as a function, and then invoke the function multiple times.\n",
    "3. If we have the same code repeated across several different programs, we can use a \"library\" to store that functionality, and then load it into any programs that might want to make use of it.\n",

    "- Libraries for handling health, finance, statistics, or any other topic you can imagine -- why re-invent the wheel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's version of libraries are known as \"modules\" and \"packages.\" You can think of a module as a single file containing code we want to reuse, and a package as a folder/directory containing modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python actually play two different roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They let us put functionality into a module, and then load that functionality (variables, data structures, functions, or data types) wherever we might need them.\n",

As we'll see, that's not how it works in Python; we give a module name, i.e., a variable name that we want defined, and then Python has to figure out how to translate that into a filename.\n",
