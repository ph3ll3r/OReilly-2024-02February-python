    "\n",
    "Remember DRY (don't repeat yourself): We want to have every piece of code in a single location.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we have several lines in a row that are roughly the same, we can combine them into a loop.\n",
    "2. If we have the same code repeated across several parts of our program, we can write that code once as a function, and then invoke the function multiple times.\n",
    "3. If we have the same code repeated across several different programs, we can use a \"library\" to store that functionality, and then load it into any programs that might want to make use of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are everywhere in software:\n",
    "- Your OS is a bunch of libraries\n",
    "- Libraries for handling health, finance, statistics, or any other topic you can imagine -- why re-invent the wheel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's version of libraries are known as \"modules\" and \"packages.\" You can think of a module as a single file containing code we want to reuse, and a package as a folder/directory containing modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python actually play two different roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They let us put functionality into a module, and then load that functionality (variables, data structures, functions, or data types) wherever we might need them.\n",
    "2. Modules in Python give us \"namespaces,\" ensuring that if two programmers use the same variable or function name, they won't conflict with one another in a \"namespace collision.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of namespaces as last names (surnames), ensuring that we don't confuse variables of the same name with one another.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. It's a keyword and a statement. It's not a function, so don't use parentheses.\n",
    "2. In many programming languages, we give a filename (i.e., a string) to the equivalent of `import`, and that file is then loaded. As we'll see, that's not how it works in Python; we give a module name, i.e., a variable name that we want defined, and then Python has to figure out how to translate that into a filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use `import`:\n",
    "- Python looks for the module on disk, and loads it, creating what we can call a \"module object,\" basically a storage facility for variables and functions.\n",
    "- Python then assigns the variable that we named after the `import` statement to that module object.\n",
    "- If the module was loaded already, then the variable is still assigned, but it isn't loaded a second time."
