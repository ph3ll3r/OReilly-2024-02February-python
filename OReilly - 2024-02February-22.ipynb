    "That's fine, except that the index numbers don't really have any meaning. What if I want to have a list of people in my company? Wouldn't it be better if I could store them not at arbitrary indexes (0, 1, 30, 256) but rather at indexes corresponding to their user IDs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: I'd like to determine not just the values, but also the indexes we use to store those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm already wishing, I'd like to use not just integers, but also strings as indexes. Those could really come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I've just described is (basically) a dictionary!\n",
    "\n",
    "- We decide on both the keys (what we call the indexes in a dict) and the values\n",
    "- The keys can be any immutable value (typically, integers and strings, but theoretically also floats and tuples)\n",
    "- The values can be absolutely anything at all\n",
    "- Each key must be unique in a dict, so each key can appear at most once\n",
    "\n",
    "Dicts are incredibly efficient and fast, as well as convenient. They're a big win for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining dicts\n",
    "\n",
    "- We define a dictionary using `{}` (curly braces)\n",
    "- Each key-value pair is defined with a colon separating the key from the value\n",
