    "\n",
    "- If we have the same code several times in a row, we can \"DRY it up\" into a loop\n",
    "- If we have the same code in several different places in our program, we can \"DRY it up\" into a function. That is: We define the function in one place, and then use it in many other places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining functions gives us many practical and semantic advantages:\n",
    "- We only have to write the code a single time.\n",
    "- When it comes time to debug/improve/change/optimize our code, having things in a function makes that so much easier\n",
    "- We gain semantic power by using a function, creating a higher level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the idea that we can take some functionality, wrap it up under a name, and not think about the underlying implementation. We can treat it as a black box that accomplishes a goal. Once we've created that abstraction, we can use it in higher-level things.\n",
    "\n",
    "By writing functions, we create higher-level abstractions. We can think at a higher level, and solve bigger problems by ignoring the nitty-gritty that's going on inside of the function. A great deal of programming involves writing functions so that we can think at that higher level."

    "- The line ends with a `:`\n",
    "- Following a `:`, we always have an indented block in Python. This is known as the \"function body,\" and it is what executes every time we invoke the function. You can put whatever code you want inside of the function body -- `if`, `input`, `print`, `for`, `while`...\n",
