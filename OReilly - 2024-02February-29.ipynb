    "- If we have the same code several times in a row, we can \"DRY it up\" into a loop\n",
    "- If we have the same code in several different places in our program, we can \"DRY it up\" into a function. That is: We define the function in one place, and then use it in many other places.\n",

    "Defining functions gives us many practical and semantic advantages:\n",
    "- We only have to write the code a single time.\n",
    "- When it comes time to debug/improve/change/optimize our code, having things in a function makes that so much easier\n",
    "- We gain semantic power by using a function, creating a higher level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the idea that we can take some functionality, wrap it up under a name, and not think about the underlying implementation. We can treat it as a black box that accomplishes a goal. Once we've created that abstraction, we can use it in higher-level things.\n",
